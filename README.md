# CPP-GUIDE

A bunch of markdown files that go over the concepts of c++ in style

## Explanation

I made this repository as a means to reflect on my prior knowledge of C/C++\
Initially, I would store my notes in a Google Docs document, which turned out to be ineffective due to how hard to navigate it became\
Hence, I chose to use github and markdown to make it more readable and manageable
